For each election since 1872, the Prohibition Party has nominated a candidate for president, and yet has only ever exceeded a 2% threshold twice, in 1888 and 1892. Despite the numerous problems associated with alcohol consumption in the United States, it seems the temperance movement has been left for dead. The year is 2024, America’s alcohol industry rakes in over 350 billion dollars annually, and it seems only a miracle could bring the concerns of the Prohibition Party to the public eye.<br><P><br>Enter Michael Wood. The Silicon Valley native and newly-retired CEO of Virtual Chip Exchange leads a ticket which once nominated esteemed president Herbert Hoover. With over 500 yearly hours of community service under his belt, Wood understands the plight of the average American and his struggles with substance abuse. With no political experience to speak of, Wood has made it his mission to revitalize the party after years of inadequacy. <br><P><br>Despite a total ban on alcohol no longer serving as the party line, many who stumble upon Wood’s candidacy write it off as soon as they see his party’s name. Because of this, Wood faces an uphill battle. Not only does the campaign have direct ballot access in just one state (Arkansas), but the party has failed to surpass 10,000 voters in every presidential election since 1976. <br><P><br>Will Wood be able to inspire excitement for the Prohibition Party? Or, like many in his party before him, is he destined for political irrelevance?<br></div></div></div></div>",
